# Tutorial 6 - Writing JUnit Tests

## Step 1

* Create a new repository for the repository from the link in blackboard.
* Connect the new repository to your eclips.
* Find the 2 packages, Line and Aggregation.

## Step 2 - Line

* Take the line package and look at the Line class and the LineTest class. This is the solution to the Line repl and the tests we used on them.
* Run the tests and look at the results. 
* Make changes to the Line method to see how the tests results change.
* For each test, rewrite it so that the explected and actual results are variables (so we can identify them) and that each assert includes a message which explains what was expected to happen.

## Step 3 - Aggregation

* This is the repl assignment "Using Aggregation".
* Generate a test class for the Receipt class, and write a test to ensure the constructor is working properly.
* Write a test class for the ReceiptList class that includes at least two tests for two different methods in the class. 
 
## Step 4 - Creating Test Suit

* Write a test suit that runs all the tests
